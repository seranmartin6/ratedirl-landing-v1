Turn this existing Replit project (currently a landing site) into a fully functional web app MVP: “Google Reviews for People” (RatedIRL). Keep the current branding/style as much as possible, but add real working functionality.

1) Overall goal

Convert landing page into a working app with:

Authentication

Profiles

Search

Reviews (stars + short text)

Consent-based/opt-in review system (important)

Nomination/invite flow

Basic admin moderation

Simple analytics dashboard

2) Tech requirements (Replit-friendly)

Use a simple, deployable full-stack setup inside Replit:

Frontend: React + Vite (or Next.js if already Next)

Backend API: Express (Node)

Database: SQLite with Prisma (easy in Replit), OR Supabase if already connected

Provide clear ENV setup instructions in README (example keys, where to paste them in Replit Secrets)

The result must run with one command and be deployable from Replit.

3) Pages / routes to implement

Public:

/ Landing (existing)

/login

/signup

Authenticated:

/app (feed or dashboard)

/people (search + results)

/people/:id (profile page with ratings summary + reviews list)

/write-review/:id (leave a review)

/nominate (nominate someone)

/settings (privacy controls)

/analytics (basic user analytics)
Admin-only:

/admin/moderation (reports queue + remove/hide reviews + ban users)

4) Authentication + verification

Auth must support:

Email + password (baseline)

Phone verification placeholder (MVP): store phone number + “verified” flag; include UI + flow even if SMS provider isn’t wired yet

Add “Verified” badge to profile:

Phone verified badge

Optional KYC “upper-tier verified” badge (MVP placeholder state + UI)

5) Core database models (implement these)

Users

id, email, passwordHash, firstName, lastName, username, photoUrl, bio, location

phoneNumber, phoneVerified (bool)

kycStatus (none/pending/verified)

role (user/admin)

createdAt

PeopleProfiles (for subjects being reviewed)

id, ownerUserId (nullable until claimed), firstName, lastName, location

contactEmail/phone (optional, for invite)

claimed (bool)

privacy: profileVisibility (public/private), reviewsVisibility (public/private)

createdAt

Reviews

id, reviewerUserId, targetProfileId

rating (1–5), text (max ~150 chars)

status (published/hidden/pending)

createdAt

Nominations / Invites

id, nominatorUserId

targetFirstName, targetLastName, contactEmailOrPhone

inviteToken, accepted (bool), acceptedByUserId (nullable)

createdAt

Reports

id, reporterUserId, reviewId, reason, status (open/closed)

createdAt

ProfileViews (for analytics)

id, viewerUserId (nullable), targetProfileId, createdAt

6) Consent-based rules (must enforce)

Reviews can ONLY be published if:

The target profile is “claimed” by a logged-in user, OR

The nominated person accepts the invite and claims the profile

If not claimed yet: store reviews as pending (not publicly visible) until claim/acceptance.

7) UX requirements

Search bar to find people by name + location

Profile page shows:

Avg rating, count, rating breakdown, recent reviews

“Claim this profile” flow if the logged-in user matches the identity (MVP: claim via invite token)

Privacy controls:

Toggle profile visibility and review visibility

Moderation:

Report review button

Admin page to hide/delete reviews and close reports

8) Deliverables

Implement the full working MVP in this Replit project

Add a README that explains:

How to run locally in Replit

What secrets are needed

How to create an admin user

How the consent-based review rule works

Make sure there are no broken routes and the app is usable end-to-end.

Start by inspecting the current codebase, identify the framework, and then implement the above step-by-step while preserving the existing landing page design.
